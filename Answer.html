<p>Here are a couple of things that I did to my website that I think improved the overall state of my website, however in essence, the website has the same essence and feels that the original does. The main differences can be seen in three categories: aesthetics, data, and access. These are all different things that are extremely important, and as you work, you get different ideas on what should be in each of them. Thus, the changes are simply responses to what I felt was necessary.
</p>

<h1>Aesthetics</h1>

<p>What is most notably different is the color pallet. This reverts away from the cool purples and bright greys and into a different one with a mellow red, dark blues and blacks. This is more effective, because of the fact that in practice, the contrast gives an overall better feel, helping you differentiate between elements on the page. These elements are also more colorful, and give a little more pizazz, than a simple monochrome website. </p><p>

Something else to note is that the use of bright colors, although interesting gets extremely boring, and the use of more nuanced, or different colors is something that maintains the viewer's attention. Not only that, but the user is also able to stare at a grey longer than a neon yellow, so the change to this color pallet ensured that the user would be able to absorb all of the information on the page.
</p>
<h1>Data</h1>
<p>
My data differences in two ways, especially surrounding what data is displayed and how it is displayed.
</p><p>
I not only have the data surrounding what are the people affected surrounding the world but also different types of data, like where to get help, advice and also many different facts that are not able to be seen through numbers. What is notable is the fact that if I look at the chart in ill be able to understand somewhat what the topic is about, but I will not understand d the why or the how of this situation, and this is what I try to address with the other showcased data. I feel as if this is justified because of the fact that it would highly benefit the viewer, by providing a holistic view, and giving opportunities to learn and read more on the issues at hand. I feel as if knowledge is the constant pursuit of knowledge, and this website tries to ensures that it does not just stop at where the facts end, but rather it starts where the links begin.
</p><p>
Fundamentally, the way the data is displayed is also different. Having 3 types of disp[lay mechanisms is extremely crucial and ensures a bunch of massive benefits. Fists having a combination of bars, numbers, words as well as a pie chart all ensure that any type of learner is able to understand this website. I try to be inclusive of people who let's say, do not understand or like what a pir chart, and thus you can use any other metric to the side, or in the circle. Also, tou are fundamentally more able to understand the data as a whole, because of the fact that if you don't understand one thing, you can look at something else, and try to understand that. Having more chances to understand just increases the overall understanding of the viewer, all of which justifies the change in the display. </p>

<h1>Accessibility</h1>
<p>Just like data, the accessibility of a website also varies in two ways.</p><p>

Opposed to just having one long webpage, dividing it up into 4 separate parts seemed like a strategic choice. This meant that I would not have to scroll up and down to compare the data. This is justified, because of the fact that I am now more able to control and look at the data on my page, and I m more able to compare data on one part and another like this. It also provides a sense of clarity o what a page is going to b on. The subheadings at the top of pages clearly indicate the content of the page, and thus, I am now more physically able to read and understand where to go based on my needs. I won't have to read through the entire page, but rather am now able to solely read a small portion of the text, or go to a specialized group.  I feel as this tab system ensures that I am ald to actually look at the data, and also consider the other thing that i need, and prioritize the needs that I might have for the data. Having this type of versatility is essential to any website, and meeting the debate of the view is essential. Thus the change of format is not only beneficial but necessary for a successful website.
</p><p>
the change of my par graph is also something that is essential. My change from a click based system to one with a bar chart provides clarity and choice, two principles that are essential in web design. The fact that now i do not have a clustered group if many different data points, but rather something that I can easily visualize is a massive benefit for the reader because of the fact that they are now fundamentally more able to use the website, and are able to understand the material stated even more. but furthermore, some people just react to different things better. One individual might like a bar chart while another might like a pie chart. having the consumer be able to pick out why this is good or badis something it is extremely good, and thus, giving choice and clarity are both things that would give the user a better experience, and understand the data more fully. an individual is also able to focus on details and be competitive at the same time. in the old model, you were forced to do the two things ta one with a single model, and a single chart, but now you are able to separate that, and are able to do both better with the combination of the bar and pie charts.
