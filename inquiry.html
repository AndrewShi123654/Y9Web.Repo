What are the problems with modern web pages?
Just as a milk stool is balanced upon the maintenance of three interdependent piers in order to maintain support, web design, and digital graphics data rely on three main principles to ensure the user experience is maximised. These are the use of complementary and comparative colours, a more interactive interface as well as ease of access to more relevant information on the subject matter.

Modern problems require modern solutions. Today, web developers of many different industries are grappling with the fact that users now have lower attention spans and wants to have a more user-friendly and interactive user experience. Things such as graphics and images now make up the modern state of web design, appealing to the needs and the urges of the users. Having an interactive system, where you can click and interact with the webpage. Using things such as graphics or click features or other components makes the user experience much better because the webpage is more interactive. Having these things also grabs the users attention and ensures that they remain on the page longer, giving them time to look at other parts of the page, including the embedded information. 

Having information on one’s fingertips is also a component that many web designers strive for. Things such as pop-ups or hover text are all now much more popular, due to the growing need for easy and quick access to information without much searching. This data has two main qualities that must be respected, consisting of continuity, and informative. Having access to relevant and concise amounts of data is extremely important for those who look at the data. Individuals get highly overwhelmed when confronted with massive amounts of data and often skip past the relevant information to save time. Thus the way individuals and reporters alike have managed to combat this is to use shorter blurbs of concise information, to give them a “taste” of the information and then guide them to even more. This has aided modern-day journalism ensuring that all individuals have a better understanding of modern news, and also has made its way into web design.

Finally, having a user experience that consists of compatible colours is one that is now gaining traction, and having a them that resembles that of the ideas they are representing. Fierier and aggressive topics such as war or consumerism often utilise brighter and warmer reds and yellows while water or humanitarian aid often utilize greys, purples and blues often in conjunction with whites. The use of certain shades are important to the overall feel of the page, where pastel colours give a softer and more loving feel, black colours with neon accents often give a punching of colour. The one thing that all of these have in com
mon though, is the use of colours that complement one another, and look compatible. Likewise, colours who do not match such as bright who does not complement such as orange and green detract from the user experience and reduces the ability for the user to understand the information. 

These are all needed and necessary because of the fact that the new wave of web design surrounding data presentation now recognize the needs of the user, especialy their response to things such as colour, and efficiency. Overall, the format and the sizing of pages now factor largely into how enjoyable, just as efficiency and having information near ensures that the user remains easily well informed. Missing any component would ensure that the overall website cannot efficiently or effectively fulfil its purpose. Overall, these websites need all of the components, just as a milk stool require all of its legs.  



Primary research / Skills
For my website, i feel as if I need a couple of tings that are necessary for a good final product. First off, learning Html, creates the basic systems of which the website is structured. Simmilarly, for all of the inspirational textual and colour features , the ues of CSS will be essential. For all of the graphics as well as the user engagement, using ,javascript will create features that alows the user to expand their knowledge on certain topics touched on the graph that the user feels to be interesting. The graph will be created on a canvas, so learning about canvases will be extremely important.Finally, having an effective outline of the website will prove ti be more important, as having access to other components, and organizing existing components will make sure that the overall website remains neat and clear.

Pro:
This website accurately displays data in a concise way and is the only one out of all of the websites that concisely displays data. The data is displayed clearly, and different points are annotated with great skill. These all contribute towards a system that ensures that the viewer understands fully what the website means. Furthermore, the graph’s significance and origins are all explicitly explained, in a concise manner, with all individuals being able to accurately understand what is on it, without spending too long on it. It is the perfect length, not being too long to be boring, while not being too short to be unclear and confusing. Overall the textual elements are extremely effective and ensure that all of the individuals can properly understand what is being comprehended.
Con:
As much as I love the colour pallet,it seems to me to be bland and non-engaging. Having tonal reds on top of white with black writing seems almost cliche to me, where this is almost the default chart colours. The need for engagement visually is one that is not fulfilled and is desperately needed for user engagement. Having bright yellows or blues to contrast this would help the graphs overall, and buying a coloured backdrop whether black or a pastel warm colour would make the website much better overall.
WhgatWhat to apply
This website is one that shows us the significance of components such as text, and how less is sometimes more. It shows us the need for balance, especialy around text length, and gives u value from annotated notes on top of the graph. Having all these short yet effective textual components make the graph much more effective and engaging than otherwise. This graph also shows us the need for different and bright colours and shows us the importance of a good colour pallet. Having the cliche bland colours are no longer engaging,yet when you brighten up a couple of colours, then you ensure that the viewer is much more engaged.

Pros: 
The graph within this is one that is extremely unique, yet displays the data accurately. The use of different coloured lines shows the general trends, and the accompanying explanations ensure that the overall message is understood by the viewer. This underdtanding is further strengthened by the use of certain colours, where blue is known for its representation of cool, while red represents a warmer colour. Similarly, the use of intensity of those colours as well as the increacting of width is a good visual way of describing the temperature at the time. Overall, the data is well explained and is displayed with effective visuals, which makes the user experience much more pleasurable, and allows them to absorb more information.
Cons: 
This data is simply not concise enough for the individual to completely understand what it is, and if they are anything like me, they would get bored half war through. This means that they would see the lovely graphics and not understand fully the significance behind. Similarly, the lack of graphics also limits the ability to do the user to engage with the graph. Where iI believe would have added drastically towards the project, would be the ability to hover over the individual lines, and see the dates and the temperatures of which they display. These two things severely detract from the overall website
What to apply:
This website gives us a key sign about how to use visual cues such as colour and shape in order to give a message that is almost self explanitory. It also shows how far only good graphs can get us, and recognizes the importance of text as well as user interaction within a website displaying data.
http://www.brandlovescore.com/blackfriday2017/#bf#anthropologie
Pros:
What I love within this website is creative and innovative design, as well as it’s user interactiveness. I believe that this website sufficiently displays data in a method that is beautiful. The sloped lines better represent the data than an ordinary bar graph, and the style found within the web page remains consistent, having similarly domed lines displaying all of the data. As well, the hover ability displays small amounts of data that then leads you to another part of the website that displays more specified data. The general colour pallet is also very suited towards the subject matter, using a black backdrop with bright neon lines as accent pieces. This clearly represents the notions around the economic status and public support around traded companies. Overall, this website archives many very good things within their website, and manages to do in an effective and visually appealing way.
Cons:
The data on this website is extremely overwhelming, and there is a substantial amount of indicators that are unexplained. The use of data is unclear, and what it is a swell as how it is shown is somewhat confusing. Having a blurb to help explain the what the information is, as well as what they impact would extremely help the user start to relate to the information. The graphics that are seen within the website are alienating to the viewer because they are confusing and the lack of a detailed explanation. This means that the viewer will not be able to as effectively understand the data.
What to apply:
This website has many things that need to be taken into account. This includes the ideas of a bold and bright colour pallet, as well as the necessity of different interactive features. Even more important is the caution against leaving facts unexplained. Doing such would lead the user to not understand the overall data as well as the significance of it, and makes the overall website extremely confusing. 



Design Brief
Thus my solution towards the three problems laid out in the beginning is to improve on existing data displays for the expressed purpose of displaying the WHO data in a better way. Most of the reviewed websites have flaws in one or more of the areas layer out in the opening, where they lack colour, interactiveness or concision of the text. These websites are all from extremely respectable websites that create amazing graphics yet are lacking in on way or another.To manage the problem surrounding the lack of colour and user engagement around the palette would be to create on that is brighter and unified. To adapt to the lack of user interactiveness, I plan to add on to existing infrastructure o graphs by creating either graphics or pop ups, that help with the display with data, and to fix problems surrounding the length and content of text, I plan to make sure the data overall us not overwhelmed, but if necessary, more data will be made available but not imposed on the user. Having all of this will make the overall website much more effective and engaging, ensuring that the user will be able to understand for the website as a whole, as well as absolve the information on the website.
